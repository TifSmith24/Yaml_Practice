Love this game since I was a little girl.

I watched it with my aunt Lizzie who taught me alot. I wish she was still here and can remember the day when she passed away. 

She was my favorite aunt. She taught me how to use a knife and folk. Took us kids out from the hood to show us something different. 

I used to get a Pepsi with my pizza.

Her daugther Audrey was my favorite cousin. Audrey used to braid my hair and knew I was gay but loved me any way. After she did my hair she would say MO HAIR CUZ! 

There is so much pain due to the lost and the missing of my family who loved me no matter what and treated me good. Despite whatever they were going through they loved me and I loved them. 

A form of pure love. 

Why am I crying?

I am crying for the lost of my family and the the lost of my family and me crying has me crying for the lost of my relationship.

I am practicing trying to let it out. Journal, not keep my emotions in. 

I am human.

I was typing this to say my two favorite people from this blood line died.

However, there is two more cousins from this part of my family and one of them Iadore and is like a dear little sister to me. 

I just got off the phone with her. I am sad I am not able to give her the money she needs while she is away. 

I pray and ask that my ancestors Lizzie and Audrey in the after life universe please continue to bless her, protect her and her babies. 

Keep her safe. 

I guess this is the start of a digtial jounral. lol 

Love you Tif and everything else will fall in line.
